## [DONE 2026-08-07 https://wellnessnest.co/blogs/news/creatine-gummies-vs-powder-which-should-you-actually-take] Ticket #1 — NEW ARTICLE

- **Status:** DRAFT trên Shopify (article id `621836861755`, chưa public — Kevin bấm publish trong
  admin: https://admin.shopify.com/store/wellnessnest1/content/articles/621836861755). Gate PASS,
  Gate 2 Admin-API PASS (3 inline <80KB + hero + 3 JSON-LD). Byline Dr. Marcus Hale.
- **Primary keyword:** `creatine gummies vs powder`
- **Secondary:** do creatine gummies work, creatine gummies absorption, 5000mg creatine gummies, creatine for beginners
- **Search intent:** comparison, buyer deciding a format
- **Collection links (≥2, verify live):** `/collections/womens-essentials-collection`, `/collections/best-seller`
- **Hero product:** `/products/fusiforce-creatine-gummies` ($69.99)
- **Comparison table:** gummies vs powder vs capsules — dose per serving, absorption, taste/GI, daily habit adherence, price per month
- **Angle:** the real question is adherence, not chemistry — creatine only works taken daily, and the format you actually stick with wins. Answer that in the answer block.
- **Author:** (from roster.json — Kevin approves)
- **Dedup note:** no existing creatine article on the blog (checked 2026-08-07)

## [DONE 2026-08-08 https://wellnessnest.co/blogs/news/creatine-for-women-over-40-what-changes-in-the-us] Ticket #2 — NEW ARTICLE

- **Primary keyword:** `creatine for women over 40`
- **Secondary:** creatine benefits for women, does creatine cause bloating in women, creatine menopause muscle loss
- **Search intent:** informational→buyer, women skeptical of a "gym bro" supplement
- **Collection links:** `/collections/womens-essentials-collection`, `/collections/best-seller`
- **Hero product:** `/products/fusiforce-creatine-gummies`
- **Comparison table:** what changes after 40 (muscle loss %, recovery, bone, brain fog) × how creatine addresses each, with citations
- **Angle:** muscle loss after 40 is measurable and creatine is one of the few supplements with real strength evidence in women — de-bro the narrative.
- **Author:** (from roster.json)
- **Dedup note:** menopause series exists but zero creatine coverage on the BLOG (checked 2026-08-07).
  ⚠ Store has an UNPUBLISHED page draft `/pages/9-surprising-things-creatine-may-do-for-women-beyond-building-muscle`
  (id 157057941819) — a page, not an article; read it before writing to avoid overlap, do not publish it.
- **Collection-claim note:** FusiForce is NOT in womens-essentials-collection (only FloraFresh + AgeAura are)
  — link the collection as a browse suggestion, never claim membership. Same trap caught in Ticket #1.

## [DONE 2026-08-09 https://wellnessnest.co/blogs/news/vaginal-probiotics-which-strains-actually-work-us-2026] Ticket #3 — NEW ARTICLE

- **Primary keyword:** `vaginal probiotics what strains work`
- **Template:** STORY (per references/article-templates.md)
- **Secondary:** probiotics for pH balance, lactobacillus for feminine health, probiotics for odor
- **Search intent:** problem-aware buyer comparing products
- **Collection links:** `/collections/womens-essentials-collection`, `/collections/best-seller`
- **Hero product:** `/products/florafresh-vaginal-probiotics-gummies` ($40.99)
- **Comparison table:** strains (L. rhamnosus, L. reuteri, L. crispatus...) × what evidence supports each × oral vs suppository delivery
- **Angle:** most "women's probiotics" are gut blends with a pink label — strain specificity is the whole game. Educate, then show FloraFresh's strains.
- **Author:** (from roster.json)
- **Dedup note:** zero feminine-health articles on blog (checked 2026-08-07)

## [DONE 2026-08-09 https://wellnessnest.co/blogs/news/turkesterone-benefits-dosing-whats-real-us-2026] Ticket #4 — NEW ARTICLE

- **Primary keyword:** `turkesterone benefits and dosing`
- **Template:** EDITORIAL (per references/article-templates.md)
- **Secondary:** is turkesterone natty, turkesterone vs ecdysterone, turkesterone results timeline
- **Search intent:** buyer researching before purchase
- **Collection links:** `/collections/mens-essential-collection`, `/collections/best-seller`
- **Hero product:** `/products/turkesterone-advanced-formula` ($75.00)
- **Comparison table:** turkesterone vs ecdysterone vs tribulus — mechanism, evidence level, who it suits
- **Angle:** separate the TikTok hype from what's actually known; honest evidence framing builds more trust (and conversions) than overclaiming.
- **Author:** (from roster.json)
- **Dedup note:** no turkesterone article exists (checked 2026-08-07)

## [DONE 2026-08-09 https://wellnessnest.co/blogs/news/nmn-and-tmg-together-why-the-pairing-matters-us-2026] Ticket #5 — NEW ARTICLE

- **Primary keyword:** `nmn and tmg together`
- **Template:** COMPARISON (per references/article-templates.md)
- **Secondary:** why take tmg with nmn, nmn methylation depletion, nmn tmg dosage ratio
- **Search intent:** informed longevity buyer (knows NMN, asking why TMG)
- **Collection links:** `/collections/ageaura`, `/collections/best-seller`
- **Hero product:** `/products/ageaura-pure-nmn-tmg-nad-complex` ($69.95)
- **Comparison table:** NMN alone vs NMN+TMG — NAD+ pathway step, methyl-group cost, what TMG restores
- **Angle:** LEAD WITH NMN (largest-dose ingredient — hard rule), TMG is the supporting actor that keeps methylation from being drained. Never lead with a minor ingredient.
- **Author:** (from roster.json)
- **Dedup note:** zero NMN/longevity articles on the blog (checked 2026-08-07)

## [DONE 2026-08-09 https://wellnessnest.co/blogs/news/urolithin-a-benefits-the-40-problem-us-buyers-miss] Ticket #6 — NEW ARTICLE

- **Primary keyword:** `urolithin a benefits`
- **Template:** STORY (per references/article-templates.md)
- **Secondary:** urolithin a vs nmn, mitophagy supplement, urolithin a muscle aging, pomegranate urolithin
- **Search intent:** informed longevity buyer comparing next-gen compounds
- **Collection links:** `/collections/ageaura`, `/collections/best-seller`
- **Hero product:** `/products/ageaura-pure-urolithin-a` ($199.99 — live URL, unlisted in nav)
- **Comparison table:** Urolithin A vs NMN+TMG — pathway (mitophagy vs NAD+), evidence, who should start where
- **Angle:** "cellular cleanup" (mitophagy) is the clearest mechanism story in longevity — explain it plainly, position vs the NAD+ pipeline, funnel to both AgeAura SKUs.
- **Author:** (from roster.json)
- **Dedup note:** zero urolithin/longevity articles on blog; topic_fitness PASS [brand] (checked 2026-08-07)

## [DONE 2026-08-09 https://wellnessnest.co/blogs/news/shilajit-energy-drops-7-ways-to-use-them-in-the-us] Ticket #7 — NEW ARTICLE

- **Primary keyword:** `shilajit energy drops how to use`
- **Template:** LISTICLE (per references/article-templates.md)
- **Secondary:** liquid shilajit vs resin, shilajit drops in coffee, fastest way to take shilajit
- **Search intent:** format-curious buyer (already sold on shilajit)
- **Collection links:** `/collections/shilajit-wellness-stack`, `/collections/mens-essential-collection`
- **Hero product:** `/products/shilajit-shockwave` ($79.99)
- **Comparison table:** drops vs resin vs gummies — onset, portability, dosing, who each suits
- **Angle:** the "Types of Shilajit Products" foundational exists — do NOT rewrite it. This is a practical how-to-use piece for the drops format, linking back to that guide.
- **Author:** (from roster.json)
- **Dedup note:** types-comparison exists (link it); no how-to-use-drops article (checked 2026-08-07)

# Batch 2 — mined from Google Ads search terms (2026-08-07)

Source: account `7385813335` (WellnessNest), `search_term_view`, window `2026-05-09 → 2026-08-07`
via Google Ads MCP. Method + refill recipe: `skills/genseo-auto-publish/references/ads-article-mining.md`.
Campaign names below are **verbatim live `campaign.name`** (hard rule — never paraphrase them).
Context that framed this batch: paid conversions concentrate in DE branded shilajit Shopping;
the US non-brand campaign spends with **zero** conversions — those exact terms are the organic
lane's job. Blog stays English/US-anchored (gate enforces); a DE-language content lane is a
separate Kevin decision, NOT covered by these tickets.

## [DONE 2026-08-09 https://wellnessnest.co/blogs/news/best-shilajit-gummies-6-us-labels-compared-2026] Ticket #8 — NEW ARTICLE (type: PPC-arbitrage + competitor comparison)

- **Primary keyword:** `best shilajit gummies`
- **Template:** LISTICLE (per references/article-templates.md)
- **Secondary:** shilajit gummies for men, himalayan shilajit gummies, shilajit gummies vs resin, aphroly shilajit gummies, gold shilajit gummies
- **Ads evidence (90d):** campaign `US · Shilajit · Category` — "shilajit gummies" 19 clicks · $88.05 · 0 conv; "himalayan shilajit gummies" 4 clicks · $7.59; "shilajit gummies for men" 1 click · $2.63. Competitor-brand searches in the same lane: "aphroly shilajit gummies" (campaign `[S] Search - SLG - Slovakia  - 2303`), "erth wellness gummies", "better alt shilajit", "gold shilajit gummies", "optimum shilajit" (all `US · Shilajit · Category`). English "best shilajit" also paid-clicked in `[S] Shopping DE - 2003` ($1.89).
- **Search intent:** buyer comparing gummy brands — the exact click we currently pay $3–4.6 for with zero paid conversions
- **Collection links:** `/collections/shilajit-wellness-stack`, `/collections/best-seller`
- **Hero product:** `/products/premium-himalayan-shilajit-gummies` ($59.99)
- **Comparison table:** Wellness Nest Premium Himalayan Gummies vs named competitor gummies (Aphroly, Erth Wellness, Better Alt) — shilajit amount per serving, fulvic acid disclosure, servings per pouch, price per serving. ⚠ Competitor specs MUST be read off their live product pages at write time — never invent a competitor number; if a spec isn't published, write "not disclosed" (that itself sells).
- **Angle:** most gummy brands hide the actual shilajit dose behind proprietary blends — teach the reader to read the panel, then let the comparison table do the selling.
- **Author:** (from roster.json)
- **Dedup note:** types-of-shilajit-products article compares FORMATS — link it, don't rewrite; no brand-comparison / best-gummies article exists (blog list checked 2026-08-07)

## [DONE 2026-08-09] Ticket #9 — NEW ARTICLE (type: authority-figure search capture)

- **Primary keyword:** `barbara o neill shilajit`
- **Template:** EDITORIAL (per references/article-templates.md)
- **Secondary:** barbara o'neill shilajit benefits, what does barbara o'neill say about shilajit, barbara o'neill minerals
- **Ads evidence (90d):** campaign `ADC | Shopping | DE | Branded | Shilajit Essential Extract |  LP | TROAS 250%` — "barbara o neill shilajit" 17 clicks · ≈$52 · **1 conv**; plus "shilajit barbara o neill" (≈$30) and "barbara o neill shilajit kaufen" (≈$20). People search her name + shilajit and it converts — an article owns that SERP for free.
- **Search intent:** followers of a health educator checking her take before buying
- **Collection links:** `/collections/shilajit-wellness-stack`, `/collections/best-seller`
- **Hero product:** `/products/shilasource-himalayan-shilajit-resin` ($59.99 — resin is the form she discusses); link gummies inline as the modern format
- **Comparison table:** what Barbara O'Neill teaches about shilajit × what published research says × what to check on a label
- **Angle:** researcher's review of her public teachings — where the science agrees, where it's thinner than she implies, and how to pick a product that holds up either way. **Accuracy guard: she has NO affiliation with Wellness Nest — never imply endorsement; that is a fabricated fact, same class as invented clinical numbers.**
- **Author:** (from roster.json)
- **Dedup note:** no authority/influencer article exists (blog list checked 2026-08-07)

## [DONE 2026-08-09 https://wellnessnest.co/blogs/news/shilajit-benefits-for-men-4-claims-ranked-us-2026] Ticket #10 — NEW ARTICLE (type: audience-segment deep-dive)

- **Primary keyword:** `shilajit benefits for men`
- **Template:** STORY (per references/article-templates.md)
- **Secondary:** shilajit testosterone, shilajit gummies for men, shilajit energy and recovery, how to increase testosterone naturally
- **Ads evidence (90d):** campaign `US · Shilajit · Category` — "shilajit benefits for men" 1 click · $1.44; "shilajit gummies for men" 1 click · $2.63; "shilajit benefits" 2 clicks · $2.69. Campaign `[S] Shopping DE - 2003` — "how to increase testosterone" 1 click · $2.07 (a Shopping ad is the wrong answer to that query; an article is the right one).
- **Search intent:** men researching testosterone/energy angle before buying
- **Collection links:** `/collections/mens-essential-collection`, `/collections/shilajit-wellness-stack`
- **Hero product:** `/products/shilasource-himalayan-shilajit-resin` ($59.99); gummies inline
- **Comparison table:** the men-specific evidence map — testosterone, energy/mitochondria, recovery, fertility — study type & strength per claim, with citations
- **Angle:** the general benefits article exists and stays general — this one answers the male buyer directly. Honest evidence grading (which claims have RCTs vs tradition) converts better than hype for this reader.
- **Author:** (from roster.json)
- **Dedup note:** general benefits + what-is articles exist — LINK both, do not restate general benefits; no men-specific article (blog list checked 2026-08-07)

## [DONE 2026-08-10 https://wellnessnest.co/blogs/news/wellness-nest-shilajit-reviews-what-85-buyers-report] Ticket #11 — NEW ARTICLE (type: review-intent / brand-SERP defense)

- **Primary keyword:** `wellness nest shilajit reviews`
- **Template:** EDITORIAL (per references/article-templates.md)
- **Secondary:** wellness nest shilajit results, shilajit before and after, is wellness nest legit
- **Ads evidence (90d):** campaign `ADC | Shopping | DE | Branded | Shilajit Essential Extract |  LP | TROAS 250%` — "wellness nest shilajit erfahrungen" (brand-review intent, converting lane); campaign `[S] Search - SLG - Slovakia  - 2303` — "shilajit gummies recenzie"; campaign `[S] Shopping DE - 2003` — "bestes shilajit testsieger" family (test-winner intent, 41+8 impr). Review-intent queries exist in every geo; today no owned page answers them.
- **Search intent:** near-buyer looking for social proof / verification
- **Collection links:** `/collections/shilajit-wellness-stack`, `/collections/best-seller`
- **Hero product:** `/products/premium-himalayan-shilajit-gummies` ($59.99); resin inline
- **Comparison table:** what customers report by theme (energy, recovery, taste/ritual, time-to-notice) × representative quotes
- **Angle:** aggregate REAL customer reviews from the store's review widget into a themed results roundup. **Accuracy guard: only quote reviews that actually exist on the store — never invent or embellish a review. Do NOT lead on lab-tested/COA as the advantage (house rule) — customer outcomes are the story.**
- **Author:** (from roster.json)
- **Dedup note:** no reviews/results article exists (blog list checked 2026-08-07)

## [x] Ticket #12 — NEW ARTICLE (type: retail-availability / where-to-buy) — LOWEST priority, run last
<!-- DONE 2026-08-13 — LIVE id 621858095419
     https://wellnessnest.co/blogs/news/where-to-buy-wellness-nest-shilajit-in-the-us-2026 -->
<!-- This was the last open ticket. The queue is now EMPTY: brand-coverage as a topic source is
     exhausted (2 vendors, both covered), so the next batch needs a real query-gap input — either
     GSC (no OAuth client on this machine; scripts/credentials.json and gsc_token.json are absent)
     or a Google Ads search-terms export. -->


- **Primary keyword:** `where to buy wellness nest shilajit`
- **Template:** EDITORIAL (per references/article-templates.md)
- **Secondary:** wellness nest shilajit amazon, is shilajit sold in stores, how to spot fake shilajit
- **Ads evidence (90d):** campaign `ADC | Shopping | DE | Branded | Shilajit Essential Extract |  LP | TROAS 250%` — "wellness nest shilajit dm" (drugstore-chain query), "shilajit von wellness nest amazon", "wellness nest shilajit kaufen" family; campaign `[S] Shopping DE - 2003` — "shilajit bestellen". Buyers ask where to purchase; the answer should be an owned page, not a reseller.
- **Search intent:** brand-navigational, checking channels & authenticity
- **Collection links:** `/collections/shilajit-wellness-stack`, `/collections/best-seller`
- **Hero product:** `/products/shilasource-himalayan-shilajit-resin` ($59.99); gummies + gold resin (`/products/pure-shilajit-gold-resin`, $75.00) inline
- **Comparison table:** buying direct vs marketplaces vs retail — authenticity guarantee, freshness/lot control, pricing, support & returns
- **Angle:** direct-from-Wellness-Nest is the only channel with guaranteed authentic product — plus a practical fake-shilajit spotting checklist (ties to the sourcing article).
- **Author:** (from roster.json)
- **Dedup note:** sourcing + lab-testing articles exist — link them; no where-to-buy article (blog list checked 2026-08-07)

## [DONE 2026-08-10 https://wellnessnest.co/blogs/news/how-to-choose-shilajit-gummies-7-checks-us-2026] Ticket #13 — NEW ARTICLE (type: LISTICLE — organic presell format)

- **Format:** LISTICLE — numbered points, each = ONE pain/benefit tied to the mechanism, skimmable,
  soft CTA. Craft: `~/PATI/LLM-Wiki/30-creative/32-copy/7-advertorial-listicle-presell-framework.md`
  (vault doctrine: listicle fits COLD readers with generic angle = blog search traffic). Still passes
  every gate — ≥900 words, US anchor, 3 inline images, ≥2 collection links.
- **Primary keyword:** `how to choose shilajit gummies` (working title: "7 Things to Check Before You Buy Shilajit Gummies")
- **Secondary:** shilajit gummies ingredients, fulvic acid content, third party tested shilajit, shilajit gummies dosage per serving
- **Ads evidence (90d):** quality/criteria-hunting visible across campaigns — `US · Shilajit · Category`: "gold shilajit gummies", "better alt shilajit", "erth wellness gummies", "optimum shilajit" (buyers comparing quality across brands); `[S] Shopping DE - 2003` + `ADC | Shopping | DE | Branded | Shilajit Essential Extract |  LP | TROAS 250%`: "shilajit beste qualität", "bestes shilajit testsieger" family. Criteria-education captures ALL of these without naming a single brand in the keyword.
- **Search intent:** cold buyer who doesn't yet know how to judge a gummy — teach the checklist, let the criteria sell
- **Collection links:** `/collections/shilajit-wellness-stack`, `/collections/best-seller`
- **Hero product:** `/products/premium-himalayan-shilajit-gummies` ($59.99)
- **Angle:** each numbered point = one criterion (actual shilajit mg per serving · fulvic acid disclosure · source transparency · servings math · sugar load · gummy-vs-resin equivalence · return policy). Product appears as the worked example of each criterion, never as a hard pitch.
- **Author:** (from roster.json)
- **Dedup note:** distinct from #8 (brand-comparison table) — this is criteria education; cross-link #8's article once live. No how-to-choose article exists (blog list checked 2026-08-07)

## [DONE 2026-08-11 https://wellnessnest.co/blogs/news/fake-shilajit-6-signs-yours-isnt-real-us-2026] Ticket #14 — NEW ARTICLE (type: LISTICLE — organic presell format)

- **Format:** LISTICLE — same craft source + gates as #13.
- **Primary keyword:** `fake shilajit` (working title: "6 Signs Your Shilajit Is Fake — and How to Verify the Real Thing")
- **Secondary:** real shilajit vs fake, how to test shilajit at home, authentic himalayan shilajit, shilajit purity test
- **Ads evidence (90d):** authenticity anxiety runs through the paid terms — "natural himalayan shilajit" (`US · Shilajit · Category`), "optimum shilajit", the DE testsieger/qualität family, and the #12 where-to-buy cluster ("wellness nest shilajit dm/amazon" = people checking channels because they fear fakes). Nobody owns this SERP with an owned page yet.
- **Search intent:** worried buyer pre-purchase OR post-purchase verification — both funnel to a trusted source
- **Collection links:** `/collections/shilajit-wellness-stack`, `/collections/mens-essential-collection`
- **Hero product:** `/products/shilasource-himalayan-shilajit-resin` ($59.99); gummies inline
- **Angle:** 6 verifiable signs (solubility & residue · burn test myth debunk · price-too-good math · label red flags · origin claims without lot traceability · texture/smell). Link the existing sourcing + lab-testing articles as depth. ⚠ House rule: do NOT lead on lab-tested/COA as THE advantage — sourcing transparency + reader empowerment is the story.
- **Author:** (from roster.json)
- **Dedup note:** sourcing + lab-testing articles exist — LINK, don't restate; no fake-spotting article (blog list checked 2026-08-07)

# BATCH 2026-08-13 — tickets #15–#22 (built WITHOUT GSC)

Kevin: *"I approve all of them, I need published articles without any delay."* The queue was empty
and GSC is still unauthorised, so this batch was sourced from what is available at $0: the live
product catalog (11 SKUs), the full 62-article blog inventory, and the `topic_fitness.py` gate.

**Why these eight and not others.** `topic_fitness.py` was returning `FAIL [covered]` on almost
every shilajit/creatine/turkesterone angle, which is what made the topic well look dry. Root cause
found and fixed today: `seg_taken` was **brand-blind** — it asked "does ANY live title contain this
segment modifier?", so *"Creatine for Women Over 40"* vetoed *"Shilajit for Women"*, and
*"Creatine Gummies vs Powder"* vetoed every `vs` comparison on the blog. Scoping the check to
articles that actually mention the brand restores the audience and comparison long-tail without
weakening the anti-cannibalisation guarantee (the page that would compete is by definition a page
about the same brand). All eight below now return `REVIEW [covered-segment]`, and Kevin's message
is the ticket-brief greenlight that verdict asks for.

**One article per brand+segment pair — do not add a second.** The moment a `vs` shilajit article
is live, `seg_taken` flips and every other shilajit `vs` topic correctly goes back to FAIL. That is
the guard working, not a regression.

All eight verified 0 matches on `suggest.json` at 2026-08-13.

Template rotation: previous three were LISTICLE, LISTICLE, EDITORIAL. Alternate across the batch.

**Uncovered SKU still with no page of its own:** `pure-shilajit-gold-resin` ($75) and
`shilajit-shockwave` ($79.99) — the gold resin FAILs the gate as `covered` because "shilajit" is
its only brand token; it needs a distinct segment angle, not a bare product page.

## Refill needed

**2026-08-13 — the queue is EMPTY.** Ticket #22 was the last open item in batch 2026-08-13
(#15–#22 all shipped). The google-ads MCP is not connected in this environment, so the
mining recipe in `skills/genseo-auto-publish/references/ads-article-mining.md` cannot be run
from a headless session. **Kevin: run the mining recipe in the app** (paid-but-not-converting
terms + converting query patterns) and append the next batch here as `# BATCH <date>`.

Still-uncovered SKUs needing a distinct segment angle, not a bare product page:
`pure-shilajit-gold-resin` ($75) · `shilajit-shockwave` ($79.99). Note that #22 now publicly
flags that the gold-resin PDP publishes no serving size — fixing that page is worth more than
an article about it.

## Shipped without a ticket

- **[DONE 2026-08-13] #23 — turkesterone timing** — mined on the day because the queue was
  empty. Coverage map across the 11 live SKUs put turkesterone as the thinnest cluster with a
  stocked $75 product: two existing articles (vs-ecdysterone, benefits-dosing), neither about
  when to take it. `topic_fitness.py` → `PASS [brand]`; live suggest.json clean on
  "turkesterone timing", "when to take turkesterone", "turkesterone with food".
  → https://wellnessnest.co/blogs/news/turkesterone-timing-food-protein-or-fasted-us-2026

Remaining uncovered after #23: `pure-shilajit-gold-resin` · `shilajit-shockwave` (both still
need a segment angle, not a bare product page).

# BATCH 2026-08-14

- [DONE 2026-08-14 https://wellnessnest.co/blogs/news/shilajit-gold-resin-review-is-75-worth-it-us-2026] **#24 — shilajit gold resin review** — `Shilajit Gold Resin Review: Worth $75? (US 2026)`
  - Product: `pure-shilajit-gold-resin` · $75 live price · EDITORIAL.
  - Intent: near-buyer audit of the documented $15 premium. Disclose the missing serving size and Supplement Facts panel. Do not repeat unsupported potency, gold, testing, or outcome claims.
  - Gates: live `suggest.json` returned no article match; `topic_fitness.py` → `PASS [brand_intent]`.

## Refill needed

**2026-08-14 — the queue is EMPTY again.** #24 was the only item in this batch and it shipped;
every heading above is `[DONE]` (#12 included, DONE 2026-08-13 in its HTML comment). No `[ ]`
ticket remains, so this run published nothing by design.

The google-ads MCP is **not connected in this headless session** (no google-ads tool is exposed —
only web search / fetch), so the mining recipe in
`skills/genseo-auto-publish/references/ads-article-mining.md` cannot be run from here.
**Kevin: run that recipe in the app** (paid-but-not-converting terms + converting query patterns)
and append the next batch below as `# BATCH <date>`.

$0 fallback if you want tickets without touching Ads: `scripts/build_catalog_tickets.py` /
`build_ctr_tickets.py` / `refresh_targets.py` / `build_rich_tickets.py` (batch 2026-08-13 was
sourced this way). Not run here — refilling the queue is your call, not this run's.

Uncovered SKU carried forward from 2026-08-13: `shilajit-shockwave` ($79.99) — still needs a
distinct segment angle, not a bare product page. `pure-shilajit-gold-resin` is now covered by #24.

# BATCH 2026-08-15

- [DONE 2026-08-15 https://wellnessnest.co/blogs/news/how-much-nmn-per-day-what-trials-used-us-2026] **#25 — how much nmn per day** — `How Much NMN Per Day: What Trials Used (US 2026)`
  - **Primary keyword:** `how much nmn per day` · **Secondary:** nmn dosage, nmn dose per day, how many mg of nmn, nmn 500mg
  - **Template:** COMPARISON (dose ladder judged tier against tier; previous #24 was EDITORIAL so the variety guard is satisfied).
  - **Products:** `ageaura-pure-nmn-tmg-nad-complex` ($69.95) · `ageaura-pure-nmn-tmg-the-essential-longevity-duo` ($59.95). Collections: `/collections/ageaura`, `/collections/best-seller`.
  - **Intent:** informed buyer who already knows what NMN is and wants the number. The two live NMN
    articles cover the TMG pairing (#5) and timing (#20); neither states a dose.
  - **Angle:** answer from the trials, not from marketing. Every human trial that measured an outcome
    sat between 250 and 900 mg/day; the largest dose-ranging trial found blood NAD+ rose with dose
    while efficacy flattened near the middle of that range. Then do the label math on our own listing.
  - **Disclose (house honesty pattern, same as #22/#24):** only ONE of the four AgeAura NMN listings
    publishes a milligram amount at all (200 mg NMN + 100 mg TMG per capsule); the other three say
    only "one capsule daily". None publishes a Supplement Facts panel or a servings-per-container
    count on the PDP. Do NOT repeat the PDP's "third-party tested" line — no COA is published
    (house rule `no-coa-competitive-advantage`).
  - **Evidence spine (all DOIs verified live against api.crossref.org this run; NCBI is IP-blocked
    from this Mac so nothing was taken from PubMed directly):**
    Okabe 2022 Front Nutr 10.3389/fnut.2022.868640 (250 mg/d, 12 wk, n=30) ·
    Katayoshi 2023 Sci Rep 10.1038/s41598-023-29787-3 (125 mg x2 = 250 mg/d, 12 wk, n=36 middle-aged) ·
    Yoshino 2021 Science 10.1126/science.abe9985 (250 mg/d, 10 wk, postmenopausal prediabetic women) ·
    Yi 2022 GeroScience 10.1007/s11357-022-00705-1 (300/600/900 mg/d, 60 d, n=80) ·
    Fukamizu 2022 Sci Rep 10.1038/s41598-022-18272-y (1250 mg/d, 4 wk, n=31).
  - **Gates:** STEP 0 live `suggest.json` = 0 article matches across 7 query variants
    (how much nmn per day / nmn dosage / nmn dose / how much nmn / nmn how many mg / nmn 500mg /
    nmn per day); positive control on "nmn" correctly returned #20 and #5.
    `topic_fitness.py` -> `REVIEW [covered-segment]` (brand nmn covered, "dosage" segment open) —
    proceeding under Kevin's standing greenlight for this mined queue (2026-08-13).
  - **Mined because the queue was empty** (DAILY-RUN section 2). GSC unauthorised and the google-ads
    MCP is absent headless, so this came from the live catalog + the live blog inventory at $0.

## Refill needed

**2026-08-15 — the queue is EMPTY again.** #25 was mined on the day (the queue was empty at 07:30)
and shipped, so nothing is left open. GSC is still unauthorised on this Mac and no google-ads tool
is exposed to a headless run, so the mining recipe in
`skills/genseo-auto-publish/references/ads-article-mining.md` still cannot run from here.
**Kevin: run that recipe in the app** and append the next batch below as `# BATCH <date>`.

$0 fallback that produced both this batch and 2026-08-13's: read the live catalog + the live blog
inventory, list the brand+segment pairs no title covers, gate each through `topic_fitness.py`, then
STEP 0 each survivor against `suggest.json`.

Segments still open after #25 (all gate to `REVIEW [covered-segment]`, none checked against
suggest.json yet — do that before writing):
`creatine gummies` + side effects · `vaginal probiotic` + side effects · `nmn` + side effects ·
`shilajit` + drops-vs-resin (note the older "Types of Shilajit Products" article already compares
drops and resin, so this one needs a genuinely narrower angle or it cannibalises).

Uncovered SKU carried forward from 2026-08-13 and 2026-08-14: `shilajit-shockwave` ($79.99) — still
needs a distinct segment angle, not a bare product page. Ticket #7 (energy drops, 7 ways to use
them) is the closest existing coverage, so a second generic drops article would cannibalise it.

**2026-08-15 (second run of the day) — queue still EMPTY, nothing published by design.** This run
was told to take the first `[ ]` heading; there is none (the only two `[ ]` strings left in this
file are the instruction line 4 and the prose on line 319). The run stopped without writing an
article rather than mining a second topic on the same day, because a same-day second article on the
remaining open segments would land next to #25 while it is still being indexed.
The google-ads MCP is **still not exposed to this headless session** (available MCP tools this run:
web search / web fetch only; the Shopify MCP is present but unauthenticated, and it is barred by
hard rule #2 anyway). **Kevin: run the mining recipe in the app**
(`skills/genseo-auto-publish/references/ads-article-mining.md` — paid-but-not-converting terms +
converting query patterns) and append the next batch below as `# BATCH <date>`.
The open segments and the uncovered `shilajit-shockwave` SKU listed directly above are unchanged and
are the shortest path to a $0 refill if you would rather not touch Ads.
